        <p id = "heading">About me</p>
        <p id = "subtext">Why are you making this website when you can just do everything you're doing here on Linkedin? It's because I like making my life harder. Also this has been pretty good practice for trying to structure my code for websites.</p>
        <p id = "subtext">I really hope you're not reading this on your phone, that must be terrible.</p>

      <div id = "Projects">
        <p id = "heading">Projects</p>
        <p id = "subtext">So there's nothing here. Awkwarrrdddd!</p>
        <p id = "subtext">I don't really know how to format this part without it looking out of place or weird, so I'll describe my projects I guess. </p>
        <p id = "subtext"> I have a discord bot called Novula that gives you cat pictures and fuels your gambling addiction. I desgined like 34 lottery tickets on my phone in order to make the lottery mechanic. My first ever function on there was the swag function. You'd typed out !n swag and it'd tell you how swag you were from scale 0-100. Ever since Discord.py got annihilated I haven't really been checking up on my baby, I'm not sure how it's doing but I might just remake it in JavaScript to practice the language.</p>
        <p id = "subtext">And I have other stuff for school which I push to Github but those repos don't really belong to me.</p>
